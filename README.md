A [URLO post](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/alternative-to-extending-enum/99278) nerd sniped me good!

This was an interesting chance to use the [`Borrow`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/borrow/trait.Borrow.html) trait.

Refer to the tests in src/lib.rs to see how it looks to use.

This is all just an experiment for me that I thought I'd share, there's no real lib or crate here to use.
